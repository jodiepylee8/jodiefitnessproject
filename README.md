### welcome to my personal project 🌸

i am training for a marathon and triathlon next year, so naturally a massive fan of strava and garmin. i love training
and i track everything here... but they don't talk to each other. strava shows pace, segments while garmin shows vo2 max, sleep but none of it connects.
i want to understand how my sleep affected my runs, or how training load is linked to recovery, to optimise my training! 🚀 <br/>

so... i decided to turn my endurance life into a data project! i plan to pull everything into one place and treat this as a data science experiment. 
exploring and analysing patterns, trends before forecasting performance... (or fatigue!) - not just looking at single trends in isolation. 
i am trying to make sense of the scattered metrics and numbers to uncover the hidden relationships and discover hidden insights. ✨
